import{A as a}from"./UIcon.47a495bc.js";const p="_JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles._ - [`wikipedia`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)\n\n<br/>\n\nThat's impressive and all, but you know what's also impressive ? shooting yourself in the foot while writing some code with this language:\n\n<br/>\n\n```js\n'11' + 1; // 111 : fair enough, string concatenation !\n'11' - 1; // 10  : why ???\n```\n\n<br/>\n\nJokes aside, I enjoyed learning this weird language, I loved creating interactive websites, from using only `vanilla js`, then `React`, `Vue`, `Angular`, `Svelte`, `Solid`, to creating my own `SPA` framework called [`Recursive`](https://github.com/RiadhAdrani/recursive) inspired by `React` and `Flutter`, which was a real eye-opener and made me skip (to some degree) some learning steps, as I am aware of what really happens internally.\n\nLet's say, I am not your `average javascript developer` 😜.\n",g=`TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adds static typing with optional type annotations to JavaScript. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript. Because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, all JavaScript programs are syntactically valid TypeScript, but they can fail to type-check for safety reasons.

<br/>

TypeScript may be used to develop JavaScript applications for both client-side and server-side execution (as with Node.js or Deno). Multiple options are available for transpilation. The default TypeScript Compiler can be used, or the Babel compiler can be invoked to convert TypeScript to JavaScript.
`,u=`Dart is a programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund and developed by Google. The programming language can be used to develop web and mobile apps as well as server and desktop applications.

Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected language with C-style syntax. It can compile to machine code, JavaScript, or WebAssembly. It supports interfaces, mixins, abstract classes, reified generics and type inference.
`,m=`Kotlin (/ˈkɒtlɪn/) is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library,[failed verification] but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise. Kotlin mainly targets the JVM, but also compiles to JavaScript (e.g., for frontend web applications using React) or native code via LLVM (e.g., for native iOS apps sharing business logic with Android apps). Language development costs are borne by JetBrains, while the Kotlin Foundation protects the Kotlin trademark.

<br/>

On 7 May 2019, Google announced that the Kotlin programming language was now its preferred language for Android app developers.Since the release of Android Studio 3.0 in October 2017, Kotlin has been included as an alternative to the standard Java compiler. The Android Kotlin compiler produces Java 8 bytecode by default (which runs in any later JVM), but lets the programmer choose to target Java 9 up to 20, for optimization, or allows for more features; has bidirectional record class interoperability support for JVM, introduced in Java 16, considered stable as of Kotlin 1.5.

<br/>

Kotlin has support for the web with Kotlin/JS, either through a classic interpreter-based backend which has been declared stable since version 1.3, or an intermediate representation-based backend which has been declared stable since version 1.8. Kotlin/Native (for e.g. Apple silicon support) is considered beta since version 1.3.
`,h=`Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.
`,y=`Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.

<br/>

Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

<br/>

As of September 2023, Java 21 is the latest version, while Java 17, 11 and 8 are the current long-term support (LTS) versions.
`,f=`C# (pronounced See sharp) is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing,: 4  strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,: 22  object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.

<br/>

The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.

<br/>

As of November 2022, the most recent stable version of the language is C# 11.0, which was released in 2022 in .NET 7.0.
`,b=`Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

<br/>

Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

<br/>

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.

<br/>

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
`,v=`React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.

<br/>

React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.
`,w=`Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. People are gonna love using your stuff.
`,S=`Svelte is a free and open-source front-end component framework and language created by Rich Harris and maintained by the Svelte core team members. Svelte is not a monolithic JavaScript library imported by applications: instead, Svelte compiles HTML templates to specialized code that manipulates the DOM directly, which may reduce the size of transferred files and give better client performance. Application code is also processed by the compiler, inserting calls to automatically recompute data and re-render UI elements when the data they depend on is modified. This also avoids the overhead associated with runtime intermediate representations, such as virtual DOM, unlike traditional frameworks (such as React and Vue) which carry out the bulk of their work at runtime, i.e. in the browser.

<br/>

The compiler itself is written in TypeScript. Its source code is licensed under MIT License and hosted on GitHub. Among comparable frontend libraries Svelte has one of the smallest bundle footprint at merely 2KB.
`,k=`Vue.js (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced "view", **which is wrong according to the french language, from which the name is coming**) is an open-source model–view–viewmodel front end JavaScript library for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.
`,J=`Nuxt.js is a free and open source JavaScript library based on Vue.js, Node.js, Vite (previously Webpack) and Babel.js. Nuxt is inspired by Next.js, which is a framework of similar purpose, based on React.js.

<br/>

The framework is advertised as a "Meta-framework for universal applications". The term universal is used here with the meaning that the goal of the framework is to enable users to create web views in JavaScript utilizing the Vue.js single file component system and that can function both as in-browser single page application (SPA) views as well as server-rendered web views which are then (after server rendering) "rehydrated" to full SPA functionality. Additionally, the framework enables users to have the content, or parts of it, fully pre-rendered on the server and served in the manner of static site generators.

<br/>

The benefits of this approach are, among others, reduced time to interactivity and improved SEO compared to SPAs, due to the fact that full contents of each page are being served by the web server before any client-side JavaScript is executed. Put alternatively, one can maintain both the benefits of traditional server-side rendered HTML pages, and improved interactivity and advanced user interface of SPAs. The core benefit of the Nuxt.js framework itself is that it makes the configuration and setup of such applications simplified and seamless to the application developer, who can simply develop UI portions of the application as if it were a more common Vue.js single file application. NuxtJS version 3.0 has been announced by the developers.
`,A=`Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell) is a free and open-source software framework developed and maintained by OpenJS Foundation. The framework is designed to create desktop applications using web technologies (mainly HTML, CSS and JavaScript, although other technologies such as front-end frameworks and Web Assembly are possible) that are rendered using a version of the Chromium browser engine and a back end using the Node.js runtime environment. It also uses various APIs to enable functionality such as native integration with Node.js services and an inter-process communication module.

Electron was originally built for Atom and is the main GUI framework behind several open-source projects including Atom, GitHub Desktop, Light Table, Visual Studio Code, WordPress Desktop and Eclipse Theia.
`,T=`Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications from a single codebase for any web browser, Fuchsia, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows. First described in 2015, Flutter was released in May 2017.
`,j=`Angular (also referred to as "Angular 2+") is a TypeScript-based, free and open-source single-page web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
`,M=`Xamarin is a Microsoft-owned San Francisco-based software company founded in May 2011 by the engineers that created Mono, Xamarin.Android (formerly Mono for Android) and Xamarin.iOS (formerly MonoTouch), which are cross-platform implementations of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and Common Language Specifications (often called Microsoft .NET).

<br>

With a C#-shared codebase, developers can use Xamarin tools to write native Android, iOS, and Windows apps with native user interfaces and share code across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. According to Xamarin, over 1.4 million developers were using Xamarin's products in 120 countries around the world as of April 2017.

<br>

On February 24, 2016, Microsoft announced it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire Xamarin.
`,C=`Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

<br/>

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting. The ability to run JavaScript code on the server is often used to generate dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, as opposed to using different languages for the server- versus client-side programming.

<br/>

Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

<br/>

The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation. OpenJS Foundation is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.
`,x=`Deno /diːnoʊ/is a runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. Deno was co-created by Ryan Dahl, who also created Node.js.

<br/>

Deno explicitly takes on the role of both runtime and package manager within a single executable, rather than requiring a separate package-management program.
